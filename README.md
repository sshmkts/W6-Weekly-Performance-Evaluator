Weekly Performance Evaluator — Week 06

This program analyzes a soccer player’s weekly performance.
The Week 06 version adds arrays and an enum, following assignment requirements.

Program Overview

The user enters the player’s name, age, number of training sessions (1–5), the hours for each session, and the average sleep per night. Training sessions are stored in an array and validated individually. The program calculates total and average training hours from the array.

An enum is used to determine the player’s level (Beginner, Intermediate, Pro). Based on this level, the program generates a simple training plan and a recovery recommendation. All reports can be viewed through a menu and saved to a file named report.txt.
